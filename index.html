                      <h2>Personal Info</h2>
                      <h1>Hello there, General Kenobi!</h1>
                        <p>I was born an Indigenous Australian, with my biological father being Yugoslavian - known today as Serbia - and Maltese. My mother is Indigenous, with Irish in her line as well. Born an angry fighting nerd, my interest in computers was set to be guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>The many years in the public school system did nothing to quell this urge to spend every waking moment on computers - in primary school I ended up breaking the barriers of a 3D robot game, and nearly breaking the computer's hard drive trying to fix it without telling anyone. In high school, I switched from breaking games to writing them - sort of - in the form of choice based text games for my friends, via text. With multiple university attempts, both in just a Learning Pathways Program and in creative writing through Curtin, I finally reconsidered the idea of breaking games and making websites. My stepdad, referred to as Dad, had been making websites and actual hardware long before I entered the picture.</p>
                        <p>The idea that video games don’t teach you anything is garbage - my first brush with Italian came from Assassins Creed II - which I remember now just a little, but I am learning with daily practice thanks to Duolingo. A revelation I had when young was that Italian and Spanish weren’t too far apart language and meaning wise, so I started to study that too. I spent 8 years learning Japanese in primary school and remember very little of it.</p>
                        <p>Writing is what I live for. I spend every spare second I’m not on the computer or playing video games, reading and writing. To the point, I’ve entered hundreds of competitions. There was one that I was most proud of myself for though: I was shortlisted for the Haywire Short Story competition in 2019. I wrote about my growing up, having my first heartbreak and how it helped me become who I am today.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned earlier, I love video games - I currently only have my laptop PC and a Switch Lite available to game on. The Sims 4 is where I would throw my life savings at, if I had any - if not for the game mods themselves, just for the completionist principle of saying “I have all Expansions, Game Packs and Item Kits they released for Sims 4.” Otherwise the Assassins Creed series, available on Switch now - mostly - is what I’m currently saving up for.</p>
                        <p>I live with my Grandad at the moment, and he lives on a 17-acre property. Between the 16 sheep - plus those currently lambing - the chickens who are for the most part nameless, he has a kelpie called “Kelpie”, and an old female ginger cat called “Megsy”. If I had a pet of my own I would look for, specifically, a Norwegian forest cat - her name would be Belly. This comes from a dream I had years ago. I already had a cat at the time - a Bengal named Snowflake - but I had such a realistic and intense dream about owning a large, fluffy grey cat called Belly. I woke up the next morning, knowing that dream would be a reality one day. It hasn’t happened yet, but it will.</p>
                        <p>I’ve never been any good at sports. In high school, I made up stories about how I was an ex table tennis champion that hadn’t played for years due to a wrist injury and had to quit the league at the request of my boyfriend, initials K.H. None of that story was true. At all. But I was rather good at badminton, not to the point of going and playing in a club - but I did gain a bit of satisfaction to hear one of my not-friend friends from high school go “Oh shit she’s actually good at this” a week after seeing me fail spectacularly at soccer. Archery is my second favourite sport. The idea of precision lead sports that are completely within your control - it's magic to watch. I wish I got to do it more often.</p>
                        <p>Between the writing, gaming, existential dread and computing, there's not much time for other pastimes, but I make time. Or at least, time signatures! I write music, in my spare time. It's not good music, but it exists. Other things I like are; pizza, swords and comic sans.</p>
                        <p>My next steps are more University, doing programming, video game design, law, music, more creative writing, history, architecture, finance and philosophy. There's no such thing as being too qualified, and they say that the Jack-of-All-Trades, Master of None, is better than the Master of One. I still will try and Master at least one.</p>

                      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                        <p>My interest in IT lies in learning about the internet. I want to know how a site can exist. Alongside that, I want to be able to diagnose computer troubleshooting in general for people who don’t know what to do.</p>
                        <p>When I was a small child, I would look forward to every time we had the class computer lab, when we would all use those old EdAlive programs to learn how to type, how to learn coordinates, and how to do basic math.</p>
                        <p>I was asked if a particular event or person sparked my interest in IT. Call me a sentimentalist - but my biggest event horizon came from watching my dad. His hours spent hunched over a computer, teaching me the little things about fixing network errors, inspired me to take up the reins on my computer journey. The other inspiration came from Minecraft. I didn’t get my start in modding, but I know, in theory, how to install mods to the game.</p>
                        <p>As it is, I have no IT experience outside of what you can consider personal.</p>
                        <p>A question I can gladly answer now that I’m a student is "Why come to RMIT?". Simple; The reputation of the RMIT precedes it, with how clear the courses and work are, and the alumni swearing by their study. I have never seen a more concise learning plan.</p>
                        <p>What I expect to learn during my studies is as such; I want to know how to make a site that works, and I want to know how to diagnose simple issues in my day to day life.</p>

                      <h2>A job? In THIS economy? Its more likely than you think.</h2>
                        <p>Psst, note for future Shay. Ask Thomas - or Anthony - how to link PDF files to open in a new tab.</p>
                        <p>I get to help people with their problems and fix what could either be a basic issue requiring 20 seconds of allowing properties, or a more in-depth problem that requires full attention. Either way, I work in an office environment and establish my expertise in the field. I love the idea of helping people especially when they have no experience in this world of computers and websites. Beyond that, I just like working with computers.</p>
                        <p>Btw, well done, you! You remembered what you were taught. Now go forth. If you make this websites colour pallet Bee Movie I'll stragle you from the past.</p>

                        <h2>So apparently, I have a personality...</h2>
                          <h1>... don't believe the lies.</h1>
                            <p>Myers-Briggs Personality: INTP</p>
                            <p>"Nerdy Personality Assessment" results. You scored 69. Nerd.</p>
                            <p>Openness: 90%, Conscientiousness: 37.5%, Extraversion: 60%, Agreeableness: 77%, Neuroticism: 83%.</p>
                            <p>I'm more feeling than I expected, in that I am more emotion sensitive than I was prepared to face. I get to take a look in a different way to teammates, who might be more logical, thinking and involved in projects. The way I can make myself less feeling, and become a better logical thinker is possibly to take more time with logic puzzles.</p>

You chose the Shopping list idea- and if you don't like ShopTimize, you can always go bck to ShopTick, or GrocerYes, or whatever lame pun we come up with. We're creative, but goddamn we aren't clever.</p>
