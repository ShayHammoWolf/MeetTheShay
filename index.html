            <h1>Hello there, General Kenobi!</h1>
            <p>I was born an Indigenous Australian, with my biological father being Yugoslavian - known today as Serbia - and Maltese. My mother is Indigenous, with Irish in her line as well. Born an angry fighting nerd, my interest in computers was set to be guaranteed.</p>
            <p>The many years in the public school system did nothing to quell this urge to spend every waking moment on computers - in primary school I ended up breaking the barriers of a 3D robot game, and nearly breaking the computer's hard drive trying to fix it without telling anyone. In high school, I switched from breaking games to writing them - sort of - in the form of choice based text games for my friends, via text. None of them was all that interested in what I was making. With multiple university attempts, both in just a Learning Pathways Program and in creative writing through Curtin, I finally reconsidered the idea of breaking games and making websites. My stepdad, referred to as Dad, had been making websites and actual hardware long before I entered the picture.</p>
            <p>The idea that video games don’t teach you anything is garbage - my first brush with Italian came from Assassins Creed II - which I remember now just a little, but I am learning with daily practice thanks to Duolingo. A revelation I had when young was that Italian and Spanish weren’t too far apart language and meaning wise, so I started to study that too. I spent 8 years learning Japanese in primary school and remember very little of it.</p>
            <p>Writing is what I live for. I spend every spare second I’m not on the computer or playing video games, reading and writing. To the point, I’ve entered hundreds of competitions. There was one that I was most proud of myself for though: I was shortlisted for the Haywire Short Story competition in 2019. I wrote about my growing up, having my first heartbreak and how it helped me become who I am today.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I love video games - I currently only have my laptop PC and a Switch Lite available to game on. The Sims 4 is where I would throw my life savings at, if I had any - if not for the game mods themselves, just for the completionist principle of saying “I have all Expansions, Game Packs and Item Kits they released for Sims 4.” Otherwise the Assassins Creed series, available on Switch now - mostly - is what I’m currently saving up for.</p>
            <p>I live with my Grandad at the moment, and he lives on a 17-acre property. Between the 16 sheep - plus those currently lambing - the chickens who are for the most part nameless, he has a kelpie called “Kelpie”, and an old female ginger cat called “Megsy”. If I had a pet of my own I would look for, specifically, a Norwegian forest cat - her name would be Belly. This comes from a dream I had years ago. I already had a cat at the time - a Bengal named Snowflake - but I had such a realistic and intense dream about owning a large, fluffy grey cat called Belly. I woke up the next morning, knowing that dream would be a reality one day. It hasn’t happened yet, but it will.</p>
            <p>I’ve never been any good at sports. In high school, I made up stories about how I was an ex table tennis champion that hadn’t played for years due to a wrist injury and had to quit the league at the request of my boyfriend, initials K.H. None of that story was true. At all. But I was rather good at badminton, not to the point of going and playing in a club - but I did gain a bit of satisfaction to hear one of my not-friend friends from high school go “Oh shit she’s actually good at this” a week after seeing me fail spectacularly at soccer. Archery is my second favourite sport. The idea of precision lead sports that are completely within your control - it's magic to watch. I wish I got to do it more often.</p>
            <p>Between the writing, gaming, existential dread and computing, there's not much time for other pastimes, but I make time. Or at least, time signatures! I write music, in my spare time. It's not good music, but it exists. Other things I like are; pizza, swords and comic sans.</p>
            <p>My next steps are more University, doing programming, video game design, law, music, creative writing, history, architecture, finance and philosophy. There's no such thing as being too qualified, and they say that the Jack-of-All-Trades, Master of None, is better than the Master of One. I still will try and Master at least one.</p>
